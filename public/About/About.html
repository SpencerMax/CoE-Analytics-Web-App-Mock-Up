                <p>Hello everyone!  We are the web analytics team for P.C. Rossin 
                  College of Engineering and Applied Science at Lehigh University.
                  Our mission is to develop analytical tools such as dashboards and 
                  custom reports that will help the marketing team be more
                  successful when making campaigns and advertisements to provide
                  value for our stakeholders.  We are currently creating a Web
                  application to make it easier for our marketing team to access
                  and interpret data.    
                </p>
                <h3>Technolgies/Tools</h3>
                <p>
                  1)  Node.js framwork for the backend
                  <p>2) Html, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend </p>
                  <p>3) Google Analytics Reporting API to fetch data from Google </p>
                  <p>4) Google Analytics Tools (i.e. dashboards and custom reports)</p>
                </p>

                <h3> Current Challenges</h3>
                <p>Google is currently in the process of ending support for Universal Analytics, which is how the 
                  College of Engineering is currently collecting data, and replacing it with a different method called GA4. 
                  This has caused issues for us as some APIs, such as the Analytics Management API, are different for the two. 
                  We have addressed this issue by working to ensure our code works with both collection methods. Another minor issue we 
                  have run into is that certain APIs require administrator access. This took some time to acquire, but once that 
                  hurdle was cleared the problem was solved.</p>
